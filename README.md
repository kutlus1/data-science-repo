### Credit Risk Scoring Prediction 

Imagine we are data scientists at the bank. We must predict whether or not a customer will fail to return a loan.
Another words we want to predict the risk of default that is the failure to pay back the money.
We have a dataset which contains important client information and default status (1/0) if the client has 
the risk of default '1', otherwise '0'. We will use this dataset to build a prediction model.

This is a supervised learning problem since we have the label (default) in the dataset and a logistic regression problem
since we will predict a **class** (positive, 1/negative, 0).

### Churn Prediction

We want to predict whether a customer will cancel the contract (churn) with the company. Once we identify the customers
who are likey to churn soon, then the company will send them promotions, offer discounts etc. to keep the customers.

We have a dataset which contains important customer information and churn information (yes/no) if the customer 
left the company in the past month or not. We will use this dataset to build a prediction model.

This is also a supervised learning problem since we have the label (churn) and a logistic regression problem since 
we will predict a class (yes/no).

### Used Car-Price Prediction

We want to predict the price of a car. Let's say we have a website where people can post ad on to sell their used cars.
We help the sellers to put a reasonable price with an automatic price recommendation based on the cars features.

We have an open dataset which contains cars with important features (model, year, mileage etc.) and manifacturer's suggested retail prices.
We will use this dataset to build a prediction model.

This is a supervised learning problem since we have the label, car prices in the dataset and a regression problem since we will predict a value. 
More specifically, it is a multiple regression problem due to the multiple feature.
